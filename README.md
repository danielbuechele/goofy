# Goofy, a desktop app for Facebook Messenger

At its core, Goofy is a simple app that shows a web view of messenger.com, but adding additional functionality you would expect from a native desktop app.

## Features

**Native Notifications**  
Receive macOS notifications when new messages arrive while the app is running. Click a notification to jump directly to that conversation. Note: Notifications only work when the Messenger app is open.

**Badge Counter**  
See your unread message count displayed on the Messenger app icon in your Dock, just like a native app. The badge updates while the app is running.

## Installation

Just download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/danielbuechele/goofy/releases/latest), unzip it and move it to your Applications folder.
